# MEL-Beta-
A voice AI that responds and does everything on computer asked by the user. It must have access to my system, NLTK, pyttsx3, SpeechRecognition, and others. More than just doing small tasks, but doing more advanced and complex tasks than what we already know. One that has access to all the system, one that can literally spoil the machine just by command of the user.
